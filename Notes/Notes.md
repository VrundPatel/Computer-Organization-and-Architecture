Computer Organization and Architecture
======================================

-   **What is a computer?**

    -   Runs on set of instructions.

    -   Ability to store massive amount of information.

    -   Processes large amount of data in a relative short amount
        of time.

-   **Bare essentials**

    -   Take an input.

    -   Produce an input.

    -   Have some kind of information storage.

    -   Processing of information.

    -   Have way to control what it does.

-   **Organization & Architecture**

    -   **Organization (How it works)**

        -   How is it controlled?

        -   Signal design

        -   Memory type

        -   Physical: circuit components

        -   Physics

    -   **Architecture (How it’s designed)**

        -   Logic and abstraction

        -   Instructions set, operation codes, and data types

        -   Memory access and input/output

-   **History of Computers**

  | Type                                   | Period          | Performance  |
  | ---------------------------------------| ----------------| -------------|
  | Mechanical Computers                   | 1630-1945       | &lt;1        |
  | Vacuum Tubes                           | 1945-1955       | 1            |
  | Transistor                             | 1955-1965       | 35           |
  | Integrated circuit                     | 1965-1980       | 900          |
  | LSI (Large System Integration) & VLSI  | 1980 – Present  | 2,400,000    |
